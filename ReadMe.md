- `tailwind-demo/` - Tailwind CSS responsive layout
- `react-demo/` - React.js interactive component
- `readME` - Description of pproject


### Bootstrap
Bootstrap provided a quick way to create a professional-looking layout with minimal code. The component-based approach made it easy to add standard UI elements like navbars and alerts. The grid system was particularly useful for responsive layouts.

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind's utility-first approach required more class names in the HTML but offered greater flexibility for custom designs. The responsive utilities (like md:grid-cols-2) made it straightforward to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes without writing media queries.

### React.js
React's component-based architecture and state management made creating interactive UI elements intuitive. The declarative approach to DOM manipulation was much cleaner than manually manipulating the DOM. Props and state provided a clear way to manage data flow within the application.

## Comparison
- **Bootstrap**: Fastest for prototyping standard layouts with consistent styling
- **Tailwind**: Most flexible for custom designs without writing CSS
- **React**: Best for complex, interactive UIs with state management needs
